WordPress One Click EZ Backup is A Simplified version of my Wordpress EZ Backup Plugin for Administrators. This Version will function without the user having to enter advanced settings and information from their webserver. This version also features a Compatibility check to ensure your webhost / webserver can support the plugin and its functions.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where does my Backup go? =
The backups all go into their own folders sorted by date of the backup located in the plugin folder itself - ex. wp-plugins/oneclick/backups/FILES is where the Archive goes and the SQL folder is where the Database dump goes

= Why is this plugin not free? =
Pretty simple really... I have had 0 support from my previous plugins. So all plugins I release from now on are going to have a price

= I get a Download Warning from Internet Explorer when I use Auto Download =
This is a built in function of Internet Explorer - it alerts you when a File download was sent to your browser. You can disable this warning message by editting the settings in Internet Explorer
Goto Tools - Internet Options - Security

Click the option that says Custom Level

and In this new menu Find the option that says

Automatic Prompting for File Downloads
Mark this option as Enabled

This option does only one thing. turns off the little warning from IE about downloading the file. You still have to click Save or Open file on the Download window like any normal download etc.
